# Mission-to-Mars

This challenge requires us to use web-scraping tools to:

* Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
* Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
* Add Bootstrap Components including one to make the website mobile responsive.

The process involved using Splinter to automate a web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data, and MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered. Other tools used include Python, Pandas functions and methods, SQLLite, SQLALchemy to filter and Flask using Jupyter Notebook and VS Code. 

Bootstrap styling components were applied to change heading colours and make the page mobile responsive by using a single set of .col-md-* grid classes to create a basic grid system that starts out stacked on mobile devices and tablet devices (the extra small to small range) before becoming horizontal on desktop (medium) devices.

The final webpage looks like the following on a laptop:
